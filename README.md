## Project Idea/Business Value
When earthquakes occur their locations are calculated very quickly and crudely in order to issue real-time alerts. More accurate locations can be determined afterwards and used to infer fault locations and make hazard assessments. But how can new location techniques be tested efficiently on a large, historical dataset? I have provided a pipeline to do this using distributed processing, which will allow researchers and policy makers to make more informed hazard determinations.
